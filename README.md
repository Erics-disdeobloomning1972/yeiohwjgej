Just got out of Home Sweet Home: Rebirth and WOW, what a whirlwind. My brain is still doing somersaults; not sure if it's the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 or the migraine from the sound system. Honestly, like, who sets it up? King Kong's personal DJ?

Anyway, this   — totally bonkers. Started with the protagonist, Anna? Or was it Sara? She had this look, like my neighbor's cat when it gets stuck in the garage — curious but slightly alarmed. I think there was a scene, ahem, where she was running through a forest? Or was it a supermarket? They really blend in, don’t they? Trees and cereal aisles. Freaking poetic.

> The popcorn's clinging to my shirt like it thinks I'm its mom or something. And my back — gosh, those seats must've been designed by someone who hates spines. But yeah, Anna/Sara leaps into reality, like, 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬ing open old ghosts from childhood, and I swear the shadows were dancing or maybe that's the nacho cheese hallucination talking.

Remember that spoiler about the dad? Bam! Hits you like a cold hot dog straight from the fridge — unexpected and kinda gross, but you go with it. And the funny guy sidekick, what was his name…Fred? No, Troy! Had this laugh, like a deflating balloon. Can't forget that if I tried.

Mother's voice echoed in the house, like spirits gossiping behind your back. The ending? Someone threw it at me, like a kid flinging spaghetti — surprise plot twist or just splat. Not sure which. Whatever, might just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for another round of 'what-the-heck' moments. But dude, next time I'll bring earplugs. Essential.

𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  ? Oliver was asking about it, like a month ago — he should definitely dive into this mess. A dip into chaos, like jumping into an unmade bed of stale chips and lost TV remotes. But in a good way, if that makes sense. I'm still questioning my own sanity after that lighting thing.
